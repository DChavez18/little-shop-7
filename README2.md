# Little Etsy Shop

## Description

The "Litte Etsy Shop" is an application that mimics an e-commerce platform.
We created an application where merchants and admins can manage inventories and fulfill customer invoices.
The application aims to be user-friendly and efficient and test our ability to:

1. Create rake tasks to load csv files
2. Use SQl and AR queries inside of model methods to retrieve data
3. Create funcitioning views that users can interact with and are easily usable
4. Consume APIs
5. Write tests using FactoryBots and Faker gems
6. Build a database with multiple tables and associations

## Summary of Work

**Merchant Dashboard**

Merchants can view their dashboard with the merchant's name.
Dashboard provides links to the merchant's items and invoices index.
Statistics display the top 5 customers and their transaction counts.
"Items Ready to Ship" section lists ordered items not yet shipped, along with invoice details.

 **Merchant Items**

Merchants can view their items index, create, update, and enable/disable items.
Top 5 most popular items are displayed with total revenue and top selling date.

**Merchant Invoices**

Merchants can view their invoices index and individual invoice details.
Invoice details include customer information, item quantities, prices, and status.

## Potential Contributions and Refactoring Ideas

1. **Improve User Interface (UI)**: Enhance the aesthetics and usability of the platform to provide an even better user experience for both merchants and customers.

2. **Test Coverage Expansion**: Add more tests to increase code coverage and ensure robustness in different scenarios.

3. **Admin Dashboard Implementation**: Create a dedicated dashboard for admins to manage various aspects of the platform efficiently.

4. **Welcome Page**: create a page that make the application easier to traverse.
